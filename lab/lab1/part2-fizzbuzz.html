    # Lab 1, Part 2 â€” FizzBuzz

    ## Introduction

    Write a program that uses console.log to print the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

    Believe it or not, this is a common programming challenge in job interviews.

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */
    // make a loop that goes from 1 to 100
    for ( var num = 1; num < 101; num ++ ) {

      // check if the number is divisible by 3 or 5
      var checkForThree = num % 3;
      var checkForFive = num % 5;

      // if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then print FizzBuzz
      if ( (checkForThree == 0) && (checkForFive == 0) )
      	console.log( "FizzBuzz");

      // if the number is divisible by 3, then print Fizz
      else if (checkForThree == 0)
        console.log( "Fizz");

      // if the number is divisible by 5, then print Buzz
      else if (checkForFive == 0)
        console.log( "Buzz");

      // otherwise just print the number
      else
        console.log( num );
    }

    /* =====================

    End code
